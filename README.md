Two personal projects:

- 2D Game in godot (Stardew Valley or Terraria like), I want to create a 2D survival game, with mechanics like planting crops, gathering resources, and interacting with characters.

- Text-based game in LC3 Aassembly, like hangman game, where the player guesses letters to reveal a hidden word and tracks progress.
